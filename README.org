* Scripts for PostgreSQL Source Install for the Wicci

These scripts attempt to install PostgreSQL from source with the customizations
desired for the Wicci System. These scripts may fail
- with a new version of PostgreSQL
- on an untried different operating system platform
- on an upgraded operating system
- when required external components are not available
- when required external components are not found

Therefore, these scripts
- Allow for multiple attempts
- Divide up the stages of each attempt
- Make lots of tests
- Stop as soon as anything important fails
- Generate logs and reports

The oldest generation is the most stable despite being fragile.

The latest attempt looks promising and it's not quite ready for use.

There have been three generations of scripts for this purpose!
- [[File:PG-Install][PG-Install]] :: links to the latest version
- [[file:PG-Install-0][PG-Install-0]] :: the oldest scripts
- [[file:PG-Install-1][PG-Install-1]] :: the first attempt at an all-in-one script
- [[file:PG-Install-2][PG-Install-2]] :: the latest attempt at an all-in-one script
- [[File:Doc/README.org][Doc README]] :: some documentation regarding this task
