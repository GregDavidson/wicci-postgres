Run them with no arguments to get help:
- [[file:pg-install][pg-install]] :: the latest install script
- [[file:renumber][renumber]] :: the renumbering script
- [[file:Makefile][make]] :: automate all the things!

You'll also need to customize, but not run:
- [[file:pg-install-profile][pg-install-profile]] :: a Configuration Profile

** Warning, Request, Advice:

These scripts run on my system
- but likely will need help to run on yours!

Please test them on your system
- and help make them better and more portable!
