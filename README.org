* Scripts for PostgreSQL Source Install for the Wicci
These scripts attempt to install PostgreSQL from source with the customizations
desired for the Wicci System. These scripts may fail
- with a new version of PostgreSQL
- on an untried different operating system platform
- on an upgraded operating system
- when required external components are not available
- when required external components are not found

Therefore, these scripts
- Allow for multiple attempts
- Divide up the stages of each attempt
- Make lots of careful tests
- Stop as soon as anything fails
- Generate good transcripts and reports

The Scripts
- [[file:pg-fetch-tarball][pg-fetch-tarball]] :: download and check PostgreSQL source tarball
- [[file:pg-clone-git][pg-clone-git]] :: download PostgreSQL git repository
- [[file:pg-install][pg-install]] :: attempt to configure, build, install PostgreSQL
