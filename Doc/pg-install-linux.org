* pg-install on Gnu/Linux

** pg-install on Debian Gnu/Linux

This should apply, more or less, to any Debian-based distro,
- Ubuntu, Mint, et al

What's written here is based on my experience with
- Linux Mint 20.3 una
- based on Ubuntu 20.04 focal
- based on debian bullseye/sid

*** Installing The Dependencies

I didn't manage to install the build-deps for version 15.0
and in my experience getting the build-deps for any recent
version is fine, i.e. the version which is in the debian focal
repository which my OS is based on..

Best to do this all in a fresh directory as root because the source "installs"
put things in the current directory and the mk-build-deps builds a lot of things
in subdirectories of the CWD!
#+begin_src sh
  sudo -i
  mkdir Postgres-Temp
  cd Postgres-Temp
  wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -
  sh -c 'echo "deb-src http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ focal-pgdg main" > \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/postgresql.list'
  apt-get update
  apt install devscripts equivs
  mk-build-deps postgresql --install --root-cmd sudo --remove
  # it installed postgresql-common-build-deps version 244.pgdg20.04+1 fwiw!
#+end_src

I didn't manage to get it to install version 15.0
#+begin_src sh
  apt-get source postgresql-15 # worked, but
  # it installed as files in the CWD
  # then when I tried 
  apt-get build-dep postgresql-15
  # it said it needed postgresql-common
  apt-get source postgresql-common # worked, but
  apt-get source postgresql-common # worked, but
  # I couldn't get a version 15 out of it
#+end_src
