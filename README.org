* Scripts for PostgreSQL Source Install for the Wicci

These scripts attempt to install PostgreSQL from source with the customizations
desired for the Wicci System. These scripts may fail
- with a new version of PostgreSQL
- on an untried different operating system platform
- on an upgraded operating system
- when required external components are not available
- when required external components are not found

Therefore, these scripts
- Allow for multiple attempts
- Divide up the stages of each attempt
- Make lots of tests
- Stop as soon as anything important fails
- Generate detailed logs and reports

The latest attempt is promising
- it works on my system :-)
- it probably won't work on yours :-(
- unless you can help make it better? :-)

There have been three generations of scripts for this purpose!
- [[file:PG-Install-2/README.org][PG-Install-2]] :: the latest all-in-one script
- [[file:PG-Install-1][PG-Install-1]] :: the first attempt at an all-in-one script
- [[file:PG-Install-0][PG-Install-0]] :: the oldest scripts
- [[file:Doc/README.org][Doc README]] :: some documentation regarding this task
